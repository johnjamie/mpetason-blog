## Using Fuel Devops on Ubuntu 16.04

The setup guides can be found in two locations. I recommend starting with the 
guide from the OpenStack docs.

[Fuel Devops OpenStack Guides](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/fuel-docs/devdocs/devops.html)  
[Fuel Devops Github](https://github.com/openstack/fuel-devops)
