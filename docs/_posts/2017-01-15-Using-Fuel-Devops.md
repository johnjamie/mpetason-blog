## Using Fuel Devops on Ubuntu 16.04

The setup guides can be found in two locations. I recommend starting with the 
guide from the OpenStack docs.

[Fuel Devops OpenStack Guides](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/fuel-docs/devdocs/devops.html)  
[Fuel Devops Github](https://github.com/openstack/fuel-devops)

To start out we'll need an ISO to use. Depending on the version we need we can find each here:

[Mirantis OpenStack Releases](https://www.mirantis.com/software/openstack/releases/)

In our example we'll be using release 8.0 (Liberty.)
